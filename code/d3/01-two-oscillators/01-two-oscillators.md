# Exercise: Two oscillators

**Source**: Turner, William (2017) "JavaScript for Sound Artists" (Chapter 14). CRC Press.

**Learning outcome**: Get a sense of how the node graph works in Web Audio and how to route different audio sources.

**Exercise**: Create two oscillators and connect them to an independent gain node respectively. This allows for individual volume control. Then sum the two gain nodes to a third gain node, and connect the latter to the audioContext destination.
