**Learning outcome**: Identify a suitable method from the Web Audio API and based on the previous example of playing a sound.

**Source**: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OscillatorNode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OscillatorNode)

**Goal** Add a button that stops to play the sound. Use the code from the file ``03-play-sound/index.html``.

**Step 1** Add a second button with a different id name, e.g. "button2".

**Step 2** Create a second ``addEventListener`` that listens to the click on this second button.

**Step 3** Add inside the ``addEventListener`` event a command that stops the oscillator (hint: use the methods provided in the page of the OscillatorNode in the Web Audio API).
