# Checklist

- Install the code editor [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). This will allow you to edit and create code.
- Open Visual Studio Code.
- Install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) Extension from VS Code. This allows to simulate your code as if it was live in the web (what is called setting a local web server, in this case using Visual Studio). You will have a link in the bottom of your editor to start and run the server automatically and also view your HTML immediately.
- Open a project (```code/d1/00-setting-up```) and click to Go Live from the status bar to turn the server on/off. 
- In Chrome, activate the JavaScript console by pressing View > Developer > Developer Tools.
- In Visual Studio Code, open the file ```index.html``` and change the text of "Hello, World!".
- Go back to Chrome and see what happens in the JavaScript console. Is the text updated?
