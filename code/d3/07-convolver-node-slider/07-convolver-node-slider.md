# Exercise: Convolver

**Source**: Turner, William (2017) "JavaScript for Sound Artists" (Chapter 16). CRC Press.

**Learning outcome**: Get a sense of how to control the amount of a reverb effect in Web Audio.

**Exercise**: This exercise is a variation of 05 and 06. It stores each sound (source and impulse response) in separate variables (instead of a dictionary) and it passes the variable name as a parameter of the function ``loadSoundToBuffer``, now renamed to ``loadSoundToBuffer``. It also adds the method ``disconnect()`` when changing betweeen two impulse responses.
